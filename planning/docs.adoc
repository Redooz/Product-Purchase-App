= SPEC-1: Product Purchase App with Payment Integration
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

The business aims to streamline the process of selling a specific product using Wompi as the payment gateway. The proposed solution includes an application to handle the entire transaction lifecycle. This lifecycle begins with showing product availability, collecting customer details, processing payment via Wompi, updating stock and transaction records, and delivering results to the customer. A robust backend and user interface will ensure seamless transactions and recovery from client-side interruptions.

== Requirements

The application must fulfill the following requirements, categorized using MoSCoW prioritization:  

=== Must Have  
- Display a user interface showing available products, their descriptions, prices, and stock levels.  
- Provide a payment type button ("Pay with credit card") and a modal for credit card information collection.  
- Validate credit card data format, ensuring compliance with common structures (e.g., MasterCard, VISA).  
- Collect delivery information from the customer.  
- Summarize the payment details, including product amount, base fee, and delivery fee, with a payment button.  
- Implement backend APIs to:  
  - Create transactions with a "PENDING" state.  
  - Call Wompi API to process payments.  
  - Update transaction status (e.g., SUCCESS, FAILURE) upon receiving Wompi's response.  
  - Assign the purchased product to the customer and update product stock levels.  
- Show the result of the transaction to the customer and refresh the product page with updated stock.  
- Ensure application resilience to recover user progress upon refresh.  

=== Should Have  
- Detect credit card type (e.g., MasterCard, VISA) dynamically with corresponding logos in the modal.  

=== Could Have  
- A polished user interface with animations for modals and backdrops for enhanced user experience.  

=== Won't Have  
- Support for multiple payment gateways (only Wompi will be integrated).  
- Multi-language support.  

== Method

To address the requirements, the system will be built with the following components and technologies:

=== Architecture Overview  
The application will follow a client-server architecture:  
- **Frontend**: A React-based single-page application (SPA) to handle UI and user interactions.  
- **Backend**: A NestJS API to handle business logic, database interactions, and external API communication (e.g., Wompi).  
- **Database**: A PostgreSQL database to store product stock, transaction data, customer details, and delivery records.

=== Workflow  
[plantuml]
----
@startuml
actor Customer
entity "Frontend App" as Frontend
entity "Backend API" as Backend
entity "Wompi Payment API" as Wompi
database "Database" as DB

Customer -> Frontend: View product page
Frontend -> Backend: Fetch product details
Backend -> DB: Query product stock

Customer -> Frontend: Click "Pay with Credit Card"
Frontend -> Frontend: Open modal for payment & delivery details
Customer -> Frontend: Enter payment & delivery details
Frontend -> Backend: Submit transaction request

Backend -> DB: Create pending transaction
Backend -> Wompi: Process payment
Wompi -> Backend: Return payment status
Backend -> DB: Update transaction status
Backend -> DB: Update product stock & assign product
Backend -> Frontend: Return payment result
Frontend -> Customer: Show transaction result
Frontend -> Backend: Refresh product page
----

=== Backend API Design  
The backend will provide the following endpoints:  

- **GET /products**: Fetch list of products with stock, price, and description.  
- **POST /transactions**: Create a new transaction with "PENDING" status.  
  - Request: `{ customerId, productId, quantity, deliveryDetails }`  
  - Response: `{ transactionId }`  
- **POST /transactions/{transactionId}/payment**: Process payment with Wompi and update the transaction status.  
  - Request: `{ creditCardDetails }`  
  - Response: `{ status, message }`  
  - Logic:  
    - Call Wompi API to process the payment.  
    - Update the transaction status (e.g., "SUCCESS", "FAILED") based on the Wompi response.  
    - If successful, reduce stock for the purchased product and assign it to the customer.  

- **GET /transactions/{transactionId}**: Retrieve transaction details.  

=== Database Schema  
- **products**:  
  - `id`: Integer, Primary Key  
  - `name`: Text  
  - `description`: Text  
  - `price`: Decimal  
  - `stock`: Integer  

- **transactions**:  
  - `id`: Integer, Primary Key  
  - `productId`: Foreign Key -> products(id)  
  - `customerId`: Foreign Key -> customers(id)  
  - `quantity`: Integer  
  - `status`: Text (e.g., "PENDING", "SUCCESS", "FAILED")  
  - `createdAt`: Timestamp  

- **customers**:  
  - `id`: Integer, Primary Key  
  - `name`: Text  
  - `email`: Text  

- **deliveries**:  
  - `id`: Integer, Primary Key  
  - `transactionId`: Foreign Key -> transactions(id)  
  - `address`: Text  
  - `deliveryFee`: Decimal  

=== Resilience Features  
- Frontend will use localStorage/sessionStorage to save customer input data (e.g., payment and delivery info) to recover progress after a page refresh.  
- Backend will store transaction states, ensuring any failed or incomplete transactions can be retried.  

=== Integration with Wompi API  
The backend will call Wompi's API to process payments and handle responses for success or failure. Webhooks from Wompi will be supported to update transaction status asynchronously if needed.

== Implementation

The implementation will follow these steps to ensure the system functions as designed:  

=== Step 1: Backend Development  
1. Set up the project environment using Node.js and Express.  
2. Configure a PostgreSQL database with the specified schema.  
3. Create API endpoints:  
   - **GET /products**: Implement logic to fetch and return product data from the database.  
   - **POST /transactions**: Implement logic to create a transaction in the database with "PENDING" status.  
   - **POST /transactions/{transactionId}/payment**:  
     - Integrate with the Wompi API for payment processing.  
     - Update the transaction status in the database based on Wompi's response.  
     - Deduct stock for the purchased product and link the product to the transaction.  
   - **GET /transactions/{transactionId}**: Implement logic to retrieve and return transaction details.  

4. Test API endpoints using tools like Postman.  
5. Secure sensitive data and API keys using environment variables and proper authentication.  

=== Step 2: Frontend Development  
1. Create a React-based single-page application (SPA).  
2. Design and implement pages and components:  
   - Product listing page: Fetch and display product details using the `/products` API.  
   - Payment modal: Include fields for credit card details and delivery information.  
     - Implement client-side validation for credit card structure.  
     - Show credit card type logos dynamically (e.g., VISA, MasterCard).  
   - Payment summary modal: Display product amount, base fee, and delivery fee.  
   - Transaction result page: Show the outcome of the payment process.  

3. Use localStorage/sessionStorage to save user progress and recover data after a page refresh.  
4. Test UI components thoroughly with mock APIs.  

=== Step 3: Testing and Quality Assurance  
1. Perform end-to-end testing with mock data for various scenarios:  
   - Valid and invalid credit card details.  
   - Successful and failed transactions.  
   - Stock updates after successful transactions.  
2. Conduct resilience tests by refreshing the page during various stages of the process.  

=== Step 4: Deployment  
1. Deploy the backend to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku) with PostgreSQL configured.  
2. Deploy the frontend to a platform like Vercel or Netlify.  
3. Ensure environment variables for Wompi API keys and database credentials are configured securely.  
4. Set up monitoring tools to track API performance and errors.  

=== Step 5: Documentation  
1. Create API documentation using tools like Swagger or Postman Collections.  
2. Document the frontend and backend setup for developers.  

=== Step 6: User Feedback and Iteration  
1. Release the app to a test audience.  
2. Gather feedback on usability and functionality.  
3. Prioritize updates based on user input.
